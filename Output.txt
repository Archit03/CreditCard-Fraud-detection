Logistic Regression:
Precision: Similar precision for both classes (around 54%).
Recall: Balanced recall for both classes (around 51-56%).
F1-score: Moderate F1-scores for both classes (around 52%).
Accuracy: 54%
Decision Tree:
Precision: Higher precision for class 1 (fraudulent transactions) but lower recall.
Recall: High recall for class 0, but very low for class 1.
F1-score: Moderate F1-score for class 0, very low for class 1.
Accuracy: 56%
Random Forest:
Precision: Higher precision for class 1, but lower recall.
Recall: High recall for class 0, very low for class 1.
F1-score: Moderate F1-score for class 0, very low for class 1.
Accuracy: 55%
AdaBoost:
